# Blood Cell Image Classification (Pytorch)
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of blood cells using Pytorch.

# Project Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images of blood cells. The model was developed in Pytorch, and took approximately 30 minutes to train on a MacBook Pro M3.

The structure of the neural net was the result of some experimentation, and seems to perform reasonably well, while still being quick and easy to train.

# Data
[The data for this project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset) consists of 17,092 images of normal cells, classified into 1 of 8 groups:
- neutrophils
- eosinophils
- basophils
- lymphocytes
- monocytes
- immature granulocytes
- erythroblasts
- platelets
